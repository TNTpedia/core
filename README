========

Static page generator for my webpage wrote in C99.

Usage
=====
generate (generate.c) takes minimum one argument:
* first argument is a file with content.
* second, optional argument is a template. Optional, because content can
  contain template variable.

generate is used by Makefile

Structure
=========
Content is just content, but it can also contain variables. Variable is
a line starting with @, followed by variable name (single word) and variable
content (anything until new line).
Examples:
	@title My title
	@template blog

Template is HTML code, but can write nested code surrounded by `%` signs (like
in node.c by Tsoding).
