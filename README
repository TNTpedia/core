stac
====

stac is a page generator wrote in C99 initially for my webpage.
This is a simple "compiler" that takes HTML with nested C code on input, and
produces HTML on output. Input and nesting C code was inspired by node.c
created by Tsoding (https://github.com/tsoding/node.c).

Usage
=====
generate (generate.c) takes minimum one argument:
* first argument is a file with content.
* second, optional argument is a template. Optional, because content can
  contain template variable.

generate is used by Makefile

Structure
=========
Content is just content, but it can also contain variables. Variable is
a line starting with @, followed by variable name (single word) and variable
content (anything until new line).
Examples:
	@title My title
	@template blog

Template is HTML code, but can write nested code surrounded by `%` signs.
For example, this will print "Hello!" 255 times:

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	%for (int i = 0; i < 255; ++i) {%
		Hello!
	%}%
